# Inspiration for Site Creation
Published on: 2023-07-13

Wow! Finding this page is a stroke of luck. Great job reader!

While this entire website is a work in progress, it will
eventually display many original artworks and photographs.

Witnessing my partner create numerous artworks in many mediums
inspired a desire to catalogue and showcase her talents, as well


as my own developing skills. Please continue checking back for
updates and if there are any inquiries, please forward them to
jparker2705@gmail.com

Thanks!
-J

This photograph was taken at the OtherWorld
exhibit in Columbus, Ohio 2023-06-18 by Strangers
upon request. 

The focus of the camera shifted mid-photo and caused
the interesting effect.
